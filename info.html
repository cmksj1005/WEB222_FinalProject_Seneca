      <h2>History</h2>
      <p align="justify">
        The history of Monopoly can be traced back to 1903, when American
        anti-monopolist
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lizzie_Magie">Lizzie Magie</a>
        created a game that she hoped would explain the single-tax theory of
        Henry George. It was intended as an educational tool, to illustrate the
        negative aspects of concentrating land-in private monopolies. She took
        out a patent in 1904. Her game, The Landlord's Game, was self-published,
        beginning in 1906.

      <h2>Rules of Monopoly</h2>
      <p align="justify">
        Each player starts with $1,500 in their bank. Players take turns in
        order, with the initial player determined by chance before the game. A
        typical turn begins with the dice rolling and advancing a piece
        clockwise around the board the corresponding number of squares. If
        players roll doubles, they move again after completing that portion of
        their turn. A player who rolls three consecutive sets of doubles on one
        turn has been "caught speeding" and is immediately sent to jail instead
        of moving the amount shown on the dice for the third roll.
      </p>
      <p align="justify">
        A player who lands on or passes the "Go" space collects $200 from the
        bank. Players who land on either Income Tax or Luxury Tax pay the
        indicated amount to the bank. In older editions of the game, two options
        were given for Income Tax: either pay a flat fee of $200 or 10% of total
        net worth (including the current values of all the properties and
        buildings owned). No calculation could be made before the choice, and no
        latitude was given for reversing an unwise decision. In 2008, the
        calculation option was removed from the official rules; simultaneously,
        the Luxury Tax was increased from $75 to $100. No reward or penalty is
        given for landing on Free Parking.
      </p>
      <p align="justify">
        Properties can only be developed once a player owns all the properties
        in that color group. They then must be developed equally. A house must
        be built on each property of that color before a second can be built.
        Each property within a group must be within one house level of all the
        others within that group.

      <h2>Joe's Best tip</h2>
      <p align="justify">
        I am a board game lover and Monopoly is one of my favorite board games.
        According to my experience with Monopoly, I recommend you to buy
        expensive lands as much as you can. Monopoly is a game which you can win
        when you make your friends bankrupt. For making them bankrupt, you need
        to bring all the money from your friends, so expensive lands will be the
        key to win the game. So when you roll the dice, you need to focus on
        landing on the expensive lands and you should buy all the lands if you
        have enough money. This is the best tip that I can give to you.

        Monopoly. I am a normal gamer, so I recommend you to watch this video to
        get a better tip for Monopoly
